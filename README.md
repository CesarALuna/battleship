# battleship
A clone of the game Battleship done in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is played against the computer which generates random guesses. I have not added the
ability for the computer to pick adjacent squares after a hit yet. 

I would like to come back to this project eventually to improve the UI and possibly improve computer 'AI'.

### bugs

        not all invalid ship placements are recognized
        possible to stack ships
        possible to start game without placing all ships
        The multiplayer does not fully work yet and I might remove it entirely.
